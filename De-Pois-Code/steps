# White Box attack (Testing composition)
1. adv_dataset = FGSM(critic, dataset)
2. accepted_images_adv = critic_classify(adv_dataset) # only get the set of adversarial images that got classified as valid (from this filter dataset to only have the accepted adv ones to make dataset_accepted)
3. adv_dataset_new = FGSM(classifier, accepted_images_adv)
4. Get	classifier acc\(adv_dataset_new) and (dataset_accepted) (EXTRA: Compare with FGSM(classifier, dataset))
# Knowledge distillation
1. Generate shadow models for (classifer, critic)
# Shadow Attack
1. Repeat White Box Attack on Shadow Models
2. Use shadow models attack on actual models
